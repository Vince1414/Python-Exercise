# Python-Exercise

#1. If/ elif/ else statement 
#Practicing if/elif/else statement by creating a random answer using the random function and having multiple output. By doing this, it helped me understand the processing thoughts. From here I feel more confident practicing with harder and more complex case.

#2. Shipping Cost 
# I built a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package out of 3 packages available. 
#a. Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
#b. Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you arenâ€™t charged for weight.
#c. Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
# the prices are determined as: 

#Ground Shipping
# Weight of Package	                          Price per Pound	      Flat Charge
# 2 lb or less	                              $1.50	                $20.00
# Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	  $3.00	                $20.00
# Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	  $4.00	                $20.00
# Over 10 lb	                                $4.75	                $20.00

#Ground Shipping Premium
#Flat charge: $125.00

#Drone Shipping 
# Weight of Package	                          Price per Pound	        Flat Charge
  2 lb or less	                              $4.50	                  $0.00
  Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	  $9.00	                  $0.00
  Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	  $12.00	                $0.00
  Over 10 lb	                                $14.25	                $0.00

#this  program is meant to asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package.
#this is more advance exercise of if/ elif/ else statement and i get to pratice more of how the statement work.

#3. practicing list with sorting items in a list, remove, insert and counting length of the list.
